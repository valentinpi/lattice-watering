\begin{frame}{Updates}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The NIB did not seem to work last week, but we finally got around it on the 1st of June. So we were able to send CoAP packets from the BR to the host and, naturally, from the BR to nodes. What did not work was sending a packet to the host. The network setup is now automated and the routes are properly configured. Additionally, we setup RPL.
        \item We added the use of GCoAP.
        \item We added DTLS support.
        \item We properly documented how the hardware is setup, especially how one can wire a node themselves.
        \item Added documentation on how to setup the hardware.
    \end{itemize}
