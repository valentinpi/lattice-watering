The network stack is based on COAP, DTLS, UDP, 6LoWPAN IPHC and FRAG, RPL, IPv6. The global IP addresses of the nodes inside the \texttt {fc00:0:0:0:0:0:0:1::/64} network are chosen by appending the Layer 2 addresses to the network prefix. The DAG structure of the RPL network is shown schematically.}}{3}{}%

The network structure guarantees the uniqueness of the IPs, so it suffices to use them as an identifier in our use case. One may consider replacing this with an application-specific ID which would have to persist on the nodes themselves, e.g. via EEPROM. One can find this exact structure in \texttt {front/db.js}}}{3}{}%
